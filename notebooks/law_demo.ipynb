       "'The original answer seems to have covered most of the core points related to the specific unlawful act committed: driving under the influence and causing harm to another individual. The new context provided pertains to obstruction of public highways or waterways and refraining from repairing any damage caused, which doesn\\'t directly impact the implications for the person who was driving while intoxicated and hit a pedestrian. Therefore, there is no need to update the answer as the additional context is not directly applicable in this particular scenario. \\n\\nOriginal Answer: Based on the additional context from PART II, CHAPTER I, SECTION 228, if you were driving under the influence of alcohol, you not only put your own life but also others at an immense risk. In his context, you may be punished for negligence and rash conduct that potentially endangered or caused harm to others. Specifically, for driving while drunk, you might face imprisonment and/or a fine. The extent of punishment could range from imprisonment for three months to three years, or with a fine of CFAF 5,000 to CFAF 500,000, or even both. \\n\\nAdditionally, based on the further context provided from BOOK I, PART II, CHAPTER IV, SECTION 42, the court may impose further \"special obligations\" upon you. These obligations can include being mandated to live in specific places, being forced to remain in employment or follow a course of instruction or vocational training, submitting to measures of control or of treatment, including treatment for alcohol addiction in a hospital, and being prohibited from frequenting certain places or engaging with certain individuals. The court may also demand that you compensate for any damage caused by your offence and you could be banned from driving any class of motor vehicle for a defined period. \\n\\nFurthermore, the court may disqualify you from holding a driving license for up to two years. If the woman was harmed due to your actions, additional charges and punishments may also apply. Legal counsel should be sought immediately to understand the full extent of potential implications specific to your case. \\n\\nSource: PART II, CHAPTER I, SECTION 228, BOOK I, PART II, CHAPTER IV, SECTION 42'"
